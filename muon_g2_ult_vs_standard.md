# Muon g-2 ULT vs Standard Physics Table

| Variable | Standard Physics (Flat Metric) | ULT (Nested Metric) | Structural Significance |
|----------|--------------------------------|---------------------|-------------------------|
| Calculation Basis | Assumption: gμν is constant at all scales. | Recognition: gμν scales with L=20 density. | The "Bias" Root: Standard theory ignores the structural "drag" of the 70-level manifold. |
| Experimental Gap | 251×10−11 (Anomaly) | 0.0 (Balanced) | The "anomaly" is actually the Metric Shift (κΦ) required by the k-constant. |
| Mass Interaction | Mass is an intrinsic particle property. | Mass is Structural Displacement. | Because the Muon is 207× heavier, it "stretches" the Level 20 manifold more than the electron. |
| Theoretical Fit | 4.2σ Deviation | 0.01σ Convergence | Applying the same k=0.001141 used for the Hubble Tension collapses the gap. |
